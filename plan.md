# Implementation Plan for Electronic Contract Management System

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create a comprehensive electronic contract management system for "إنجازك الأمثل" using Next.js. The system will include features for contract management, user authentication, payment tracking, notifications, and reporting with full multi-branch support and detailed electronic signature workflow.

## Feature Set

### 1. Contract Management
- Create and manage contracts with automatic ID generation
- Support for different contract types:
  - عقد اتفاق (Agreement Contract)
  - عقد إشراف على الهيكل الخرساني (Concrete Structure Supervision Contract)
  - عقد إشراف شامل التشطيبات (Comprehensive Finishing Supervision Contract)
- Archive contracts automatically based on conditions
- Multi-branch contract management (Jeddah, Mecca, Al-Ahsa, Hali)

### 2. Electronic Signature Workflow (Detailed Implementation)
- **Step 1: Contract Creation & Client Link Generation**
  - Generate unique signing links for each contract
  - Send secure links to clients via email/SMS
  - Track link expiration and usage

- **Step 2: Client Signature Process**
  - Client accesses contract via unique link
  - Canvas-based signature capture for clients
  - Automatic contract locking after client signature
  - Real-time notifications to employee and management

- **Step 3: Employee Approval & Signature**
  - Employee receives notification of client signature
  - Employee reviews and approves contract
  - Apply pre-stored employee signature to "الطرف الأول" section
  - Employee electronic signature using stored signature data

- **Step 4: Management Final Approval**
  - Management receives approval notification
  - Final approval with electronic seal application
  - Digital stamp/seal placement on contract
  - Contract status update to "fully executed"

- **Step 5: Final Processing**
  - Generate final PDF with all signatures and seals
  - Store signed contract in system archive
  - Send final contract copy to client via browser notification (future SMS integration)
  - Complete contract workflow logging

### 3. Payment Management and Notifications
